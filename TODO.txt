- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL
- Replace nearest neighbors checks in Graph with FLANN

- Write ROS wrapper to communicate with cozmo
	- inputs from robot: current position of robot (we are assuming known map), goal for robot
	- outputs: path as set of configurations/points

- Start MRdRRT implementation
	- implement ImplicitGraph class
	- implement Tree class
	- Add some notion of a robot?


Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap
