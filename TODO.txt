- PRM ROS node: test with rotations. Just send service calls
- Measure Cozmo for radius
- animated visualization of path

- try timing, profiling

Most expensive function right now is oracle, which includes getneighbors which
constructs all possible combinations of neighbors, and iterates thru them linearly
to find closest point

Also, some nodes in PRM end up getting more neighbors because current code searches
thru nodes linearly for neighbors within a certain distance when connecting. This
could also be addressed with a proper nearest neighbors libary, or randomization.

- Clean up code!
	- add asserts for preconditions. 'assert condition, "message"'
	- move plots and animations into separate class?

- Implement local connector with ordering
- Test tighter environments that require coordination

Later
- Replace nearest neighbors checks with FLANN
- proper pydocs
- Add some notion of a robot?
- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL?

Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap()

Question for Oren: if local_connector with ordering is done for each edge, and
some edges require a certain order of movements to be collision-free, do we save
the orderings in the edge?
