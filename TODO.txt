- check for feasibility of start and goal configs
- fix 3 robot planning
- Fix oracle: check collision along qnear and node closest to qrand
- animated visualization of path
- Clean up code! Make sure everything is in the right place. go thru small todos in code

- Implement local connector with ordering


Question for Oren: if local_connector with ordering is done for each edge, and
some edges require a certain order of movements to be collision-free, do we save
the orderings in the edge?


	- Replace nearest neighbors checks with FLANN

	- Add some notion of a robot?
	- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL?

Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap()
