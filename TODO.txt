Question for Oren: if local_connector with ordering is done for each edge, and
some edges require a certain order of movements to be collision-free, do we save
the orderings in the edge?

        - Fix oracle: check collision along qnear and node closest to qrand 
        - Implement some kind of visualization with movement - step thru each step? 
	- Clean up code! Make sure everything is in the right place
        - Implement local connector with ordering


	- Replace nearest neighbors checks with FLANN

	- Add some notion of a robot?
	- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL

Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap()
