- Make path visualization with thicker edges actually work
- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL
- Replace nearest neighbors checks in Graph with FLANN
- Add some notion of a robot
- Add a way for PRMPlanner to save map and roadmap for repeated use (pickle?)

- Write ROS wrapper to communicate with cozmo
	- inputs from robot: current position of robot (we are assuming known map), goal for robot
	- outputs: path as set of configurations/points

- Start MRdRRT implementation
	- implement DiscreteGraph class
	- implement Tree class


Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap
