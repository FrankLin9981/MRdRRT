- animated visualization of path
- Clean up code! Make sure everything is in the right place. go thru small todos in code
	- move plots and animations into separate class?
	- add asserts for preconditions. 'assert condition, "message"'

- Implement local connector with ordering
- Test tighter environments that require coordination

Later
- Replace nearest neighbors checks with FLANN
- proper pydocs
- Add some notion of a robot?
- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL?

Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap()

Question for Oren: if local_connector with ordering is done for each edge, and
some edges require a certain order of movements to be collision-free, do we save
the orderings in the edge?
