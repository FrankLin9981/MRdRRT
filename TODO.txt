Question for Oren: if local_connector with ordering is done for each edge, and
some edges require a certain order of movements to be collision-free, do we save
the orderings in the edge?

	- Clean up code!!!

	- Replace nearest neighbors checks in Graph with FLANN

	- Add some notion of a robot?
	- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL


Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap
